* org-html-parser
This is a simple cli tool to convert org-mode files to html. Although there already plenty of parsers just like this tool, I wanted to make something with more features and functionality as well as to learn. This tool will have a number of precreated css templates that can be easily loaded as well as choices to automatically create tags to make it easier to intergrate to a number of different templating engines (e.g. Jinja, Genshi, Go templates).
